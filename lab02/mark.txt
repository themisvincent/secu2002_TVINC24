notes:
-error when running strings.py (using backtick ` instead of quote ')
-need better commenting and testing
-not quite right solution for clip.py
-also can't compile len_sum.py
-it is extremely obvious that the code in dna.py is plagiarized from
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25188968/reverse-complement-of-dna-strand-using-python, and i can't
 even run the code. therefore i'm discounting all other work in this lab and
 giving you both a 0. this is a real shame as you could have earned a 2 or 3
 based on the other work (even if you had handed in nothing for this)
